# RuneScape-Quest-Web
This is the quest web for RuneScape instructions in readme.txt


You'll need a couple of things. 
Easy way and only way I know/recommend is downloading XAMPP. 

copy paste the folder given into C:\..\xampp\htdocs\
launch xampp and run the module Apache.

once done the basic should be done and you can access the little program via http://localhost/runescape/


here's the fun part and... the longest Tv T

the folder runescape already has a lot of .csv files. one of them is for all the existing quests in the game and their requirements.

another is the same name list of quests only this one is for the user to mark down all quests already completed
last one is the player's stats. that's about it. anything else i employ you to take a look yourself
i'm happy to answer questions but too many is never gonna get us through. ^^;
