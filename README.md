# RuneScape-Quest-Web
This is the quest web for RuneScape instructions in readme.md


You'll need a couple of things. 
Easy way and only way I know/recommend is downloading XAMPP. 

copy paste the folder given ergo "Runescape" into C:\..\xampp\htdocs\
so example C:\xampp\htdocs\runescape\
launch xampp and run the module Apache.

once done the basic should be done and you can access the little program via http://localhost/runescape/


here's the fun part and... the longest Tv T

the folder runescape already has a lot of .csv files. one of them is for all the existing quests (runescapeQuests.csv)in the game and their requirements.

another is the same name list of quests only this one is for the user to mark down all quests already completed (playerDoneQuests.csv)
last one is the player's stats (playerLevels.cvs). that's about it. anything else i employ you to take a look yourself
i'm happy to answer questions but too many is never gonna get us through. ^^;

PS: sorry for the lack of comments in my code i'm a horrible person
